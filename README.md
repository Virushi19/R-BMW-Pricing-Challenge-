The provided R code conducts a comprehensive analysis of BMW car pricing data, covering data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization. The analysis includes steps such as data loading, filtering, and transformation, followed by EDA using scatterplot matrices and violin plots to explore relationships between price and various features. Multiple linear regression models are built with stepwise variable selection based on AIC and BIC criteria, alongside LASSO and Ridge regression models using glmnet. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared, with visualizations depicting actual vs. predicted prices. The final analysis includes investigating cars with low prices and exporting model coefficients and evaluation metrics to CSV files. The code and report together provide a thorough understanding of the factors influencing BMW car prices and the performance of predictive models.
